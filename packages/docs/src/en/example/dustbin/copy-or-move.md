This example demonstrates a drop target that accepts copy and move drop effects, and the user can toggle between them by holding or releasing the alt key while dragging.

For example, in a to-do list app, the default drag-and-drop action can be used to sort the list, and holding the alt key while dragging and dropping copies the to-do item to the drop target instead of moving it.
